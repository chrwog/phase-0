###What does puts do?

puts prints the output to the counsole with a new line underneath. It returns nil.

###What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a number with no decimal. A float also known as a floating-point number is a number with decimal points.

###What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

The difference between float and integer division is that integer division will only output the whole number rounded down. For example 9 divided by 4 will give you 2. I would explain this to someone as dividing numbers with a remainder like in elementry school, but forgetting about the remainder. So 9 divided by 4 equals 2 (with a remainder of 1 which we ignore).
