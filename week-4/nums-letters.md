###What does puts do?

puts prints the output to the counsole with a new line underneath. It returns nil.

###What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a number with no decimal. A float also known as a floating-point number is a number with decimal points.

###What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

The difference between float and integer division is that integer division will only output the whole number rounded down. For example 9 divided by 4 will give you 2. I would explain this to someone as dividing numbers with a remainder like in elementry school, but forgetting about the remainder. So 9 divided by 4 equals 2 (with a remainder of 1 which we ignore).

###Mini-Challenges
```ruby
puts 24 * 365
puts 60 * 24 * 365 * 10
```

####How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

Ruby handles it by reading left to right, with addition and subtraction very similar to how a person would solve it on paper. For multiplication ruby uses * for multiplication and / for division. Division changes depending on wether integers or floats are used.  

####What is the difference between integers and floats?

Integers are numbers without decimals. Floats are numbers with any sort of decimal.

####What is the difference between integer and float division?

Integer division will only give you the whole number rounded down. Float division will give you a decimal.

####What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

Strings are a bunch of characters, like words or numbers or punctuation grouped together. You would use these when you want to manipulate a group of characters or to print text lines out. You would use this over integers if you wanted to display the numbers as text and manipulate them as such.

####What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

Local variables are declared in the file and can only be used within. You would want to use these when you only need them for the file that they are in. This will prevent outside files from being able to access those variables.

####How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

The challenge started slow, but once I completed the first challenge the others were easier.
