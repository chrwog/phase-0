What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?

It is very important that you get the href right. It might seem obvious, but by making sure your setup is correct, you can be sure any errors or issues will be CSS related and not setup.

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?

We tried to reuse some classes to reduce the amount of unique classes in the code. It was harder than expected to get the website looking just like the original. We got close, but it's not exact.

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)

Color, background-color, width, font-size, text-align, among a few others.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?

Yes we used both. We used classes when we thought we would be able to use the CSS associated with it in other elements. We used ids when we felt we would only be using specific CSS once.

When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?

I think they had cleaner code, but it was all in HTML. I think that when the site was developed it might have followed best practice, but with CSS, our code used best practice by having the styling separate from the HTML.
