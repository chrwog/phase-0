2.3 Reflection
 
1. What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

	Information Gathering - What are the Purpose, Goals, target audience, and content
	Planning - Develop a site map 
	Design - Create a wireframe. Also determine the look and feel of the site (logos, fonts, colors etc.) based off of the gathered information
	Development - create the actual website. Implement the actual systems planned for use. 
	Testing and Delivery - Test the functionality of all pages, buttons and systems. Gather feedback and then send it to the client. 
	Maintenance - Update with new content or changes as required.
	
2. What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
	
	The Primary purpose of my site is to let people learn about me. My site will contain professional information, current projects, some hobbies and a blog.

3. What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
	
	My target audience's interests are on my experience, personality, contact info, and what I'm currently doing. I see my site addressing them with a mixture of professional and personal information to paint a broad picture of what I am about. This would include an about me page, blog, work experience page, project page and contact information.

4. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

The primary action would be for visitors see my about me with links to the other pages.

5. What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

One of the main things is to make sure you gather as much information on what is needed for the design before doing anything else. Whether it's for a client, friend or yourself, information gathering is vital for the other steps of designing a website or system. If you don't have enough information, you may waste resources designing and adding features the client or audience doesn’t care for. With user experience the main idea is to design around how the end-user will feel. Not how fancy you can make the site, or what only works for you. It is important to make sure the target audience has a pleasant experience otherwise they may not be back.

6. What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

User experience design is designing based off of how a person feels when interfacing with the system. It is based off the needs and wants of users. One way it does this is by making sure the system is accessible through different devices and users all have a similar experience. This is valuable because designing with the user experience in mind will leave the user with a good impression. If a user has a good impression of the system, they will be more inclined to use it, or tell others about it.

7. Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
