Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

After creating an account, click on the "+" button on the top right of the screen, then click New repository. Next, type a name for the repository under the Repository name box. Then click Add a license: None near the bottom of the screen and change it to MIT license. Then click Create repository.

To clone the repository copy the HTTPS clone URL on the right side of the repository page. Open the terminal program. Go to the directory you would like to clone the repository to. Type "git clone " then past the url after. Hit enter and you're done!

Describe what open source means.

Open source means the code for the program is open for anybody to view and modify however they want. It also means that the code can be freely redistributed. Users may use the code to build other programs or build on top of the original program. 

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think Open Source is great for certain programs. It allows many people to create new and exciting programs based off of previous developed programs. However it doesn't make sense for all programs. Depending on what a person is developing, they may want to keep the code private in order to protect what they've done. There can be sensitive data in private programs that wouldn't make sense to share with the public.

Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses are important for establishing rules on how your code can be used and developed. They help with assuring the original programmer gets credit for their contributions when due as well as reduce plagiarism. It also saves time for the developer of popular programs so that the developer doesn't have to respond to individual requests for their work.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

The concept of cloning and committing changes to a repository have definitely been solidified during this lesson. I still need more practice but I'm  feeling more comfortable with making changes locally and then committing them to GitHub. The "aha" moment happened when I was able to reproduce the steps for cloning and committing a change with only looking at the cheatsheet to confirm my steps. I initially struggled with git status and seeing the files that I changed. I was able to fix the problem by using the add command for one of the files in the directory.
